# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-10-08

### Features

- Editor font size setting for the query, script and snippet editors, with
  shortcuts to increase, decrease and reset it (rebindable, also in the View
  menu)
- Connection option to show only the configured database in the sidebar and
  the command palette (PostgreSQL and SQL Server)
- Text in the SQL view and the script log can be selected with the mouse and
  copied

### Fixes

- Completion on slow or flaky connections: a metadata fetch is no longer
  restarted on every keystroke, a failed fetch is no longer cached as an empty
  result, and suggestions stay available while the cache refreshes
- Metadata fetches for completion now respect the query timeout setting
- Word Wrap and Render Whitespace toggled from the menu or the command palette
  are now remembered across restarts
