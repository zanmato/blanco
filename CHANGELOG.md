# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Features

- The sidebar follows the active tab: switching tabs, or opening a table
  from the command palette, selects that tab's table, view or routine,
  loading and opening the groups above it and scrolling it into view. Follow
  Active Tab in the General settings turns it off
- A search field in the title bar opens the command palette and shows its
  shortcut
- Blanco checks for new releases hourly and shows an Update button in the
  title bar when one is out. It downloads the release, then turns into Restart
  to apply it. On a .deb install it opens the release page instead. Check for
  Updates in the General settings turns the check off
- Duplicate in the connection context menu opens the new connection dialog
  filled in from that connection, with its passwords left out
- A system notification when an agent asks to run a write over MCP while
  Blanco is in the background. Clicking it brings Blanco forward, where the
  confirmation dialog is waiting

### Fixes

- The sidebar selection no longer jumps to another row or disappears when
  the tree refreshes or a group above it is collapsed and opened again
- Clicking a cell in the results table no longer starts a text selection in
  the SQL view that follows the pointer with no button held

## [0.1.2] - 2026-10-08

### Features

- Editor font size setting for the query, script and snippet editors, with
  shortcuts to increase, decrease and reset it (rebindable, also in the View
  menu)
- Connection option to show only the configured database in the sidebar and
  the command palette (PostgreSQL and SQL Server)
- Text in the SQL view and the script log can be selected with the mouse and
  copied

### Fixes

- Completion on slow or flaky connections: a metadata fetch is no longer
  restarted on every keystroke, a failed fetch is no longer cached as an empty
  result, and suggestions stay available while the cache refreshes
- Metadata fetches for completion now respect the query timeout setting
- Word Wrap and Render Whitespace toggled from the menu or the command palette
  are now remembered across restarts
